# OEIS Enhanced Search

An enhanced version of the OEIS search. You can only search through the first 30000 sequences (A000001 - A030000) for performance & relevance.

Searches are case-sensitive ("ABC" is different from "abc"). You can also select through several categories using the "Show all results" dropdown to easily find what you're looking for.

You can also look for only unique or repeating numbers, & look for sequences in increasing/decreasing order. Or both!

This tool only shows up to 5000 results, so you may have to refine your search, or look it up in the [official OEIS site.](https://oeis.org)

This tool was made to conveniently, precisely search OEIS sequences, & is not affiliated with the official OEIS company. All data compiled as of 6 Mar 2025.
