# OEIS Enhanced Search

An enhanced version of the OEIS search. You can only search through the first 40000 sequences (A000001 - A040000) for relevance.

Searches are case-insensitive. You can also select through several categories using the "Show all results" dropdown to easily find what you're looking for. You can also look for only unique or repeating numbers.

This tool may sometimes show too many results & freeze, so you may have to be more specific about your search.

This tool was made to conveniently, precisely search OEIS sequences, & is not affiliated with the official OEIS company. All data compiled as of 7 Mar 2025.
